# THE ACTUAL QUESTIONS

## Assignment-4

1. Create a class called shape which has members called calarea() and display(). Calculate the area for three different
   shapes: triangle (scalene triangle), rectangle and circle. Apply method overloading to control the area parameter and
   display the area through main.


2. Create class sum and demonstrate constructor overloading by adding two, three parameters. If someone passes no
   parameter the message will display “ Bucket is empty”.
