# THE ACTUAL QUESTIONS

## Assignment-9

1. Create a class ‘staticDemo’ which contains method ‘member’ that prints the value of a variable ‘a’ which has initialized in static block 
and print the value of the argument which will be passed to member method. 
Create a static block which will initialized another variable ‘b’  in terms of ‘a’ (where b is 4 times of a) . Show that when and how static block will be called. 
Also check whether static block is enough to execute a program without main of your system.  

2. Write a program to demonstrate method hiding.
